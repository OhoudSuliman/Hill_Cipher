# Hill_Cipher
The hill cipher was developed by the mathematician Hill in 1929. It is one of the symmetric key algorithms. Hill ciphers are techniques that use the key matrix to transform plaintext P into ciphertext C, which is to encrypt the plaintext.  decrypt the ciphertext using the inverse key matrix to transform the C back into P.
